    <h2>What is a White Bread?</h2>
    <p><strong>White bread</strong> is a type of bread made from refined wheat flour, which gives it a light color and soft texture. It has a mild, slightly sweet flavor and is often enriched with vitamins and minerals. Common varieties include sandwich bread, baguettes, and rolls. Unlike whole-grain bread, white bread lacks the bran and germ, making it less fibrous but smoother and fluffier. It's widely used for toast, sandwiches, and snacks.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 cups warm water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Â½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>8 cups bread flour</li>
    </ul>
 
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine warm water, yeast, salt, oil, sugar, and 4 cups flour. Mix thoroughly, and let sponge rise until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Gradually add about 4 cups flour, kneading until smooth. Place dough in a greased bowl, and turn several times to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough, let it rest a few minutes. Divide dough into three equal parts. Shape into loaves, and place in three 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch greased bread pans. Let rise until almost doubled.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes. The loaves may need to be covered for the last few minutes with foil to prevent excess browning.</li>
    </ol>
